# token-sync

A secure Clarity-based system for synchronizing tokenized assets across the Stacks blockchain, providing robust asset management and cross-contract interoperability.

## Overview

token-sync is a comprehensive framework for tracking and synchronizing tokenized assets across different contracts on the Stacks blockchain. The system enables secure token movement tracking, prevents double-spending issues, and provides a standardized way for contracts to interact with tokenized assets regardless of their original implementation.

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

### Token Registry (`token-registry`)
- Central source of truth for token relationships and mappings
- Maintains relationships between original tokens and their representations
- Enables verification of token authenticity and state tracking

### Token Synchronizer (`token-synchronizer`)
- Manages synchronization between different token representations
- Ensures consistent state across contracts
- Prevents double-spending through controlled synchronization operations

### Authentication Manager (`auth-manager`)
- Handles authentication and permission management
- Maintains registry of authorized contracts and users
- Provides centralized security layer for sensitive operations

### Event Tracker (`event-tracker`)
- Records and manages system events
- Provides transparent audit trail of operations
- Enables monitoring and troubleshooting

### Token Adapter (`token-adapter`)
- Standardizes interface for different token implementations
- Provides abstraction layer for token interactions
- Supports multiple token standards (SIP-009, SIP-010, custom)

## Key Features

- Secure token synchronization across contracts
- Comprehensive permission controls and authentication
- Event tracking and auditability
- Support for multiple token standards
- Flexible token representation mapping
- Robust error handling and validation

## Smart Contracts

### Token Registry
The central registry contract that manages token relationships:
```clarity
;; Register a new token
(register-token (token-id (string-ascii 64)) (name (string-utf8 64)) (token-type uint) 
                (original-contract principal) (metadata-uri (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Add token representation
(add-token-representation (token-id (string-ascii 64)) (contract-principal principal) 
                         (representation-id (string-ascii 64)))
```

### Token Synchronizer
Manages the synchronization of tokens across contracts:
```clarity
;; Configure token sync pair
(configure-token-sync-pair (primary-token (string-ascii 32)) (secondary-token (string-ascii 32)) 
                          (enabled bool) (conversion-rate uint))

;; Initiate synchronization
(initiate-sync (primary-token (string-ascii 32)) (secondary-token (string-ascii 32)) (amount uint))
```

### Authentication Manager
Handles permissions and access control:
```clarity
;; Register users and permissions
(register-user (user-principal principal) (permissions uint))

;; Check authentication
(check-auth (caller principal) (permission uint))
```

### Event Tracker
Records system events and provides audit trail:
```clarity
;; Record new event
(record-event (event-type uint) (token-id (optional uint)) 
              (target-contract (optional principal)) (details (optional (string-ascii 256))))

;; Query events
(get-events-by-token (token-id uint))
```

### Token Adapter
Provides standardized interface for token operations:
```clarity
;; Register token implementation
(register-token (token-id (string-ascii 32)) (contract-address principal) (token-type (string-ascii 10)))

;; Transfer tokens
(transfer (token-id (string-ascii 32)) (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))
```

## Security

The system implements multiple security measures:
- Comprehensive permission controls
- Authentication checks for all sensitive operations
- Event logging for audit trails
- Validation checks for all operations
- Protection against double-spending

## Usage

1. Register tokens in the Token Registry
2. Configure synchronization pairs in the Token Synchronizer
3. Set up permissions in the Authentication Manager
4. Use the Token Adapter to interact with different token implementations
5. Monitor operations through the Event Tracker

## Installation

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. Deploy the contracts in the following order:

1. auth-manager
2. token-registry
3. event-tracker
4. token-adapter
5. token-synchronizer

## Development

Built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.
